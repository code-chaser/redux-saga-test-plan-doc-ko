Saga Test Plan\n\n\n\n쉽게 Redux Saga를 테스트하세요.\nRedux Saga Test Plan은 saga 테스트를 쉽게 만듭니다. 이펙트들의 검증과 순서를 테스트 해야 하거나\n특정 시점에 saga put의 특정 액션을 테스트 해야 할때 Redux Saga Test Plan를 적용하세요.\n\nRedux Saga Test Plan는 saga를 쉽게 테스트 할 수 있게 단위 테스트와 통합 테스트 방법에 대해 모두 \n포용하는 것을 목표로 합니다.\n\n통합 테스트 하기\n글로벌 Promise가 필요합니다.\nsaga 단위 테스트의 단점은 테스트가 구현코드와 결합된다는 것입니다. 단순히 saga에서 반환되는 이펙트들의\n순서를 변경하는것 만으로도 테스트가 깨집니다. 테스트가 기능적으로 동일하더라도 그렇습니다. \nsaga에서 반환되는 effect의 검증이나 순서에 관심이 없다면, Redux Saga가 실행될 때 saga의 동작을 \n통합적으로 접근해서 테스트할 수 있습니다. 그럴려면 expectSaga 테스트 함수를 사용해서 saga가 실행되는 \n동안 반환된 일부 이팩트를 간단하게 테스트 하면 됩니다. \n\n간단한 예제\nexpectSaga 함수를 import 하고 saga 함수를 첫번째 인자로 전달하세요. 그리고 saga 함수의 인자들을 \nexpectSaga 함수의 추가 인자로 전달하세요. expectSaga 함수의 반환값은 Redux Saga에서 사용가능한\n다양한 이팩트 생성자들을 검증할 수 있는 체인화된 API 입니다.\n\n다음 예제는, 성공시에 fakeUser 데이터를 가지는 RECEIVE_USER 액션을 put하는\nuserSaga를 테스트합니다. expectSaga를 호출하고 userSaga와 api 객체를 인자로 제공합니다.\nput 검증 메서드를 통해 put 이팩트를 검증합니다. 그리고, 사용자 id 데이터를\n포함하는 REQUSET_USER 액션을 dispatch 메서드와 함께 호출합니다. dispatch 메서드는 take\n이팩트에게 액션을 제공합니다. 마지막으로 Promise를 반환하는 run 메서드를 호출하여 test를 시작합니다.\nexpectSaga로 하는 테스트는 항상 비동기적으로 실행되므로 saga가 종료되거나 expextSaga가 타임아웃 될때\n반환된 Promise가 실행됩니다. Jest 같은 테스트 러너를 사용한다면, Jest 내부로 Promise를 반환하여\nJest가 테스트의 종료를 알게 할 수 있습니다.\n\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction* userSaga(api) {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('just works!', () => {\n  const api = {\n    fetchUser: id => ({ id, name: 'Tucker' }),\n  };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    // 최종적으로 `put`이 실행되는지를 검증합니다.\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 42, name: 'Tucker' },\n    })\n\n    // saga가 `take`할 액션을 발행하세요.\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n\n    // 테스트를 시작되고 Promise가 반환됩니다.\n    .run();\n});\n\nProviders 로 모의(Mock)하기\nexpectSaga는 Redux Saga로 saga를 실행하기 때문에 어플리케이션에서의 Redux Saga처럼 이펙트들을 \n실행하려 합니다. 통합 테스트에서는 이것이 장점이지만, 가끔 빠르게 전체 앱을 테스트 하기가 어려워지기도 합니다.\n이런 경우 expectSaga의 값들을 완벽하게 모의하는 providers 를 사용 할 수 있습니다. providers는 \n미들웨어와 비슷하게 이펙트들이 Redux Saga에 접근하기 전에 가로챕니다. Redux Saga에서 이팩트를\n처리하는 대신 모의 값을 반환하도록 할 수도 있고, 다른 전에 providers나 Redux Saga에 이팩트를 전달\n할 수도 있습니다.\n\nexpectSaga의 providers는 static providers와 dynamic providers, 2가지로 나뉩니다.\n정적 providers는 쉽게 조합과 재사용이 되고, 동적 providers는 비결정적인 이펙트들로 유연함을 줍니다.\n다음 예제는 정적 providers를 사용하였습니다. providers의 더 많은 예제는 \n여기\n에 있습니다.\n\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport { throwError } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* userSaga() {\n  try {\n    const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n    const pet = yield call(api.fetchPet, user.petId);\n\n    yield put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user, pet },\n    });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches the user', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { name: 'Jeremy', petId: 20 };\n  const fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [call(api.fetchUser, 42), fakeUser],\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchPet), fakeDog],\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user: fakeUser, pet: fakeDog },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('handles errors', () => {\n  const error = new Error('error');\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), throwError(error)],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nmatcher와 가짜 값을 포함하는 튜플의 쌍(혹은 배열의 쌍)의 배열을 전달하는 것을 확인하세요. Redux Saga의\n이팩트 생성자 혹은 이팩트에 대응하는 redux-saga-test-plan/matchers 모듈의 matchers를 사용할\n수 있습니다. Redux Saga Test Plan의 matchers를 사용하면 call.fn 같은 martchers의 경우 이 함수와\n대응되는 실제 call 이팩트가 포함하는 특정 args 에 대헤 신경쓰지 않고 사용할 수 있습니다. 두번째\n테스트는 redux-saga-test-plan/providers 모듈의 throwError 함수로 에러들을 시뮬레이트합니다. \n이것은 서버 문제를 시뮬레이션하기 좋습니다.\n\nReducer 테스트하기\n리듀서 테스트 역시 통합 테스트의 좋은 예입니다. 리듀서 함수를 withReducer 메서드와 함께 호출하는 것만으로\n리듀서를 테스트해볼 수 있습니다.\n\nimport { call, select, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nconst HAVE_BIRTHDAY = 'HAVE_BIRTHDAY';\nconst UPDATE_DOG = 'UPDATE_DOG';\n\nconst initialState = {\n  dog: {\n    name: 'Tucker',\n    age: 11,\n  },\n};\n\nfunction reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  if (action.type === HAVE_BIRTHDAY) {\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      dog: {\n        ...state.dog,\n        age: state.dog.age + 1,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nconst getDog = state => state.dog;\n\nfunction* saga(api) {\n  yield take(UPDATE_DOG);\n  const dog = yield select(getDog);\n  yield call(api.updateDog, dog);\n}\n\nit('handles reducers', () => {\n  const api = { updateDog() {} };\n\n  return expectSaga(saga, api)\n    .withReducer(reducer)\n\n    .call(api.updateDog, {\n      name: 'Tucker',\n      age: 12,\n    })\n\n    .dispatch({ type: HAVE_BIRTHDAY })\n    .dispatch({ type: UPDATE_DOG })\n\n    .run();\n});\n\n단위 테스트하기\n만약 saga가 반환하는 특정 순서의 이팩트들의 값을 검증하고 싶다면 testSaga

Instead of supplying a static\nvalue, you can supply a function that produces the value. This function takes as\narguments the matched effect as well as a next function. Additionally, you\nmust wrap the function with a call to the dynamic function from the\nredux-saga-test-plan/providers module. Inside the provider function, you can\ninspect the effect further and return a mock value or return a call to the\nnext function. Returning a call to the next function will tell Redux Saga\nTest Plan to try the next provider, similar to a middleware stack. If there are\nno more providers, then Redux Saga Test Plan will let Redux Saga handle the\neffect.\nimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport { dynamic } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\n\nconst add2 = a => a + 2;\n\nfunction* someSaga() {\n  const x = yield call(add2, 4);\n  const y = yield call(add2, 6);\n  const z = yield call(add2, 8);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'DONE', payload: x + y + z });\n}\n\nconst provideDoubleIf6 = ({ args: [a] }, next) => (\n  // Check if the first argument is 6\n  a === 6 ? a * 2 : next()\n);\n\nconst provideTripleIfGt4 = ({ args: [a] }, next) => (\n  // Check if the first argument is greater than 4\n  a > 4 ? a * 3 : next()\n);\n\nit('works with dynamic static providers', () => {\n  return expectSaga(someSaga)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(add2), dynamic(provideDoubleIf6)],\n      [matchers.call.fn(add2), dynamic(provideTripleIfGt4)],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'DONE', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nOther Examples\nParallel Effects via all\nProviders work on effects yielded inside an all effect:\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield all([\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ]);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides values for effects inside arrays', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      [select(selectors.getName), 'Tucker'],\n      [select(selectors.getAge), 11],\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nProviding in Forked/Spawned Sagas\nProviders work for effects in forked/spawned sagas too.\nimport { call, fork, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* fetchUserSaga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser);\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nfunction* forkingSaga() {\n  yield fork(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nfunction* spawningSaga() {\n  yield spawn(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nit('provides values in forked sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(forkingSaga)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), fakeUser],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('provides values in spawned sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(spawningSaga)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), fakeUser],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMore Examples\nFor some more contrived examples of providers, look in the\nrepo tests.\nCaveats\nFor providers to work, expectSaga will necessarily wrap forked/spawned sagas\nwith an intermediary generator called sagaWrapper in order to intercept\neffects. To ensure that your saga receives back a task object with a correct\nmeta.name property, Redux Saga Test Plan will attempt to rename the sagaWrapper\nfunction to the name of a forked saga. This works in almost all JavaScript\nenvironments but will fail in PhantomJS. Therefore, you can't depend on the\ntask meta.name property being correct in PhantomJS.\n"},"docs/integration-testing/mocking/dynamic-providers.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/mocking/dynamic-providers.html","title":"Dynamic Providers","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic Providers\nYou can use completely dynamic providers by passing in an object literal to the\nprovide method.

If you don't want\nto handle the effect yourself, you can pass it on to Redux Saga by invoking the\nnext callback parameter.\nHere is an example with Jest to show you how to supply a fake value for an API\ncall:\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the API call', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        // Check for the API call to return fake value\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          const id = effect.args[0];\n          return { id, name: 'John Doe' };\n        }\n\n        // Allow Redux Saga to handle other `call` effects\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nEffect Creators\nEven though you'll probably never need them all, you can supply a provider for\nalmost every effect creator:\n\nall\nactionChannel\ncall *\ncancel\ncancelled\ncps\nflush\nfork\ngetContext\njoin\nput **\nrace\nselect\nsetContext\nspawn\ntake **\n\n*Because there is no way to distinguish the apply and call effects, you\nmust handle apply effects with the call provider function.\n**To handle takeMaybe and putResolve, use the take and put providers,\nrespectively. You can inspect take effects for the maybe property and put\neffects for the resolve property.\nOther Examples\nSelect\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const name = yield select(selectors.getName);\n  const age = yield select(selectors.getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the selector', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nParallel Effects via all\nProviders work on effects yielded inside an all effect.\nimport { all, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield all([\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ]);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides values for effects inside arrays', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nOr you can provide a value for the entire array of effects via the all\nprovider:\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield all([\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ]);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the entire array', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      all: () => ['Tucker', 11],\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nRace\nimport { call, put, race, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nconst delay = time => (\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time))\n);\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const { user } = yield race({\n    user: call(api.fetchUser, id),\n    timeout: call(delay, 500),\n  });\n\n  if (user) {\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } else {\n    yield put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' });\n  }\n}\n\ntest('fetching the user succeeds', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' };\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ user: fakeUser }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\ntest('timeout wins', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ timeout: undefined }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\nErrors\nYou can simulate errors by throwing from a provider:\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('can throw errors in the saga', () => {\n  const error = new Error('Whoops...');\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          throw error;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ error, type: 'FAIL_USER' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nProviding in Forked/Spawned Sagas\nProviders work for effects in forked/spawned sagas too.\nimport { call, fork, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* fetchUserSaga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser);\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nfunction* forkingSaga() {\n  yield fork(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nfunction* spawningSaga() {\n  yield spawn(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nit('provides values in forked sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(forkingSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('provides values in spawned sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(spawningSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Providers\nYou can supply multiple object providers via a couple of methods. The easiest\nway is to pass in an array of object providers to the provide method. Provider\nfunctions will be composed according to the effect type, meaning the provider\nfunctions in the first object will be called before subsequent provider\nfunctions in the array.\nBecause provider functions are composed, they are similar to middleware. The\nnext function argument inside provider functions allows you to delegate to the\nnext provider in the middleware stack. If no more providers are available, then\nnext will delegate to Redux Saga to handle the effect as normal.\nimport { call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport api from 'my-api';\nimport * as selectors from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.findUser, 1);\n  const dog = yield call(api.findDog);\n  const greeting = yield call(api.findGreeting);\n  const otherData = yield select(selectors.getOtherData);\n\n  yield put({\n    type: 'DONE',\n    payload: { user, dog, greeting, otherData },\n  });\n}\n\nconst fakeUser = { name: 'John Doe' };\nconst fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\nconst fakeOtherData = { foo: 'bar' };\n\nconst provideUser = ({ fn, args: [id] }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findUser ? fakeUser : next()\n);\n\nconst provideDog = ({ fn }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findDog ? fakeDog : next()\n);\n\nconst provideOtherData = ({ selector }, next) => (\n  selector === selectors.getOtherData ? fakeOtherData : next()\n);\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      { call: provideUser, select: provideOtherData },\n      { call: provideDog },\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nAn alternative to supplying multiple provider objects is to only pass one object\ninto provide and use the composeProviders function to compose multiple\nprovider functions for a specific effect. You can import the composeProviders\nfunction from the redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. The provider\nfunctions are composed from left to right.\nimport { composeProviders } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call: composeProviders(\n        provideUser,\n        provideDog\n      ),\n\n      select: provideOtherData,\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMore Examples\nFor some more contrived examples of providers, look in the\nrepo tests.\nCaveats\nFor providers to work, expectSaga will necessarily wrap forked/spawned sagas\nwith an intermediary generator called sagaWrapper in order to intercept\neffects. To ensure that your saga receives back a task object with a correct\nmeta.name property, Redux Saga Test Plan will attempt to rename the sagaWrapper\nfunction to the name of a forked saga. This works in almost all JavaScript\nenvironments but will fail in PhantomJS. Therefore, you can't depend on the\ntask meta.name property being correct in PhantomJS.\n"},"docs/integration-testing/partial-matching.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/partial-matching.html","title":"Partial Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Partial Matching Assertions\nSometimes you're not interested in the exact arguments passed to a call effect\ncreator or the payload inside an action from a put effect. Instead you're only\nconcerned with if a particular function was invoked via call or if a\nparticular action type was dispatched via put. You can handle these situations\nwith partial matcher assertions.\nThe following assertions have a like method along with convenient helper\nmethods for partially matching assertions:\n\nactionChannel\napply\ncall\ncps\nfork\nput\nput.resolve\nselect\nspawn\n\nNOTE: the like method requires knowledge of the properties on effects such\nas the fn property of call and the action property of put. Essentially,\nlike allows you to match effects with certain properties without worrying\nabout the other properties. Therefore, you can match a call by fn without\nworrying about the args property.\nExample\nHere is a simple example using like:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.like({ fn: api.fetchUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.like({ action: { type: 'FAIL_USER' } })\n    .run();\n});\n\nNotice that we can assert that the api.fetchUser function was called without\nspecifying the arguments. We can also assert in a failure scenario that an\naction of type FAIL_USER was dispatched without worrying about the error\nproperty of the action.\nHelper Methods Example\nWe can simplify the previous example with the convenient matcher helper methods\ncall.fn and put.actionType:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.fn(api.fetchUser)\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.actionType('FAIL_USER')\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Properties\nIf you need it in rare cases, you can match on multiple shallow or deep\nproperties via like:\nfunction* saga(id) {\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 42,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n\n  // This will be matched\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 43,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n}\n\nit('can match on multiple properties', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .put.like({\n      action: {\n        type: 'FOO',\n        payload: 43,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nHelper Methods\nThere are other some common helper methods like fn and actionType available,\nappropriate to the kind of effect:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactionChannel.pattern\nMatch actionChannel by pattern. Useful if you use custom buffers with actionChannel.\n\n\napply.fn\nMatch apply by fn.\n\n\ncall.fn\nMatch call by fn.\n\n\ncps.fn\nMatch cps by fn.\n\n\nfork.fn\nMatch fork by fn.\n\n\nput.actionType\nMatch put by action.type.\n\n\nput.resolve.actionType\nMatch put.resolve by action.type.\n\n\nselect.selector\nMatch select by selector function.\n\n\nspawn.fn\nMatch spawn by fn.\n\n\n\n"},"docs/integration-testing/negated-assertions.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/negated-assertions.html","title":"Negated Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Negated Assertions\nYou can negate assertions too.
