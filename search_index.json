Saga Test Plan\n\n\n\n쉽게 Redux Saga를 테스트하세요.\nRedux Saga Test Plan은 saga 테스트를 쉽게 만듭니다. 이펙트들의 검증과 순서를 테스트 해야 하거나\n특정 시점에 saga put의 특정 액션을 테스트 해야 할때 Redux Saga Test Plan를 적용하세요.\n\nRedux Saga Test Plan는 saga를 쉽게 테스트 할 수 있게 단위 테스트와 통합 테스트 방법에 대해 모두 \n포용하는 것을 목표로 합니다.\n\n통합 테스트 하기\n글로벌 Promise가 필요합니다.\nsaga 단위 테스트의 단점은 테스트가 구현코드와 결합된다는 것입니다. 단순히 saga에서 반환되는 이펙트들의\n순서를 변경하는것 만으로도 테스트가 깨집니다. 테스트가 기능적으로 동일하더라도 그렇습니다. \nsaga에서 반환되는 이팩트의 검증이나 순서에 관심이 없다면, Redux Saga가 실행될 때 saga의 동작을\n통합적으로 접근해서 테스트할 수 있습니다. 그럴려면 expectSaga 테스트 함수를 사용해서 saga가 실행되는 \n동안 반환된 일부 이팩트를 간단하게 테스트 하면 됩니다. \n\n간단한 예제\nexpectSaga 함수를 import 하고 saga 함수를 첫번째 인자로 전달하세요. 그리고 saga 함수의 인자들을 \nexpectSaga 함수의 추가 인자로 전달하세요. expectSaga 함수의 반환값은 Redux Saga에서 사용가능한\n다양한 이팩트 생성자들을 검증할 수 있는 체인화된 API 입니다.\n\n다음 예제는, 성공시에 fakeUser 데이터를 가지는 RECEIVE_USER 액션을 put하는\nuserSaga를 테스트합니다. expectSaga를 호출하고 userSaga와 api 객체를 인자로 제공합니다.\nput 검증 메서드를 통해 put 이팩트를 검증합니다. 그리고, 사용자 id 데이터를\n포함하는 REQUSET_USER 액션을 dispatch 메서드와 함께 호출합니다. dispatch 메서드는 take\n이팩트에게 액션을 제공합니다. 마지막으로 Promise를 반환하는 run 메서드를 호출하여 test를 시작합니다.\nexpectSaga로 하는 테스트는 항상 비동기적으로 실행되므로 saga가 종료되거나 expextSaga가 타임아웃 될때\n반환된 Promise가 실행됩니다. Jest 같은 테스트 러너를 사용한다면, Jest 내부로 Promise를 반환하여\nJest가 테스트의 종료를 알게 할 수 있습니다.\n\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction* userSaga(api) {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('just works!', () => {\n  const api = {\n    fetchUser: id => ({ id, name: 'Tucker' }),\n  };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    // 최종적으로 `put`이 실행되는지를 검증합니다.\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 42, name: 'Tucker' },\n    })\n\n    // saga가 `take`할 액션을 발행하세요.\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n\n    // 테스트를 시작되고 Promise가 반환됩니다.\n    .run();\n});\n\n프로바이더로 모의(Mock)하기\nexpectSaga는 Redux Saga로 saga를 실행하기 때문에 어플리케이션에서의 Redux Saga처럼 이펙트들을 \n실행하려 합니다. 통합 테스트에서는 이것이 장점이지만, 가끔 빠르게 전체 앱을 테스트 하기가 어려워지기도 합니다.\n이런 경우 expectSaga의 값들을 완벽하게 모의하는 프로바이더 를 사용 할 수 있습니다. 프로바이더는 \n미들웨어와 비슷하게 이펙트들이 Redux Saga에 접근하기 전에 가로챕니다. Redux Saga에서 이팩트를\n처리하는 대신 모의 값을 반환하도록 할 수도 있고, 다른 전에 프로바이더나 Redux Saga에 이팩트를 전달\n할 수도 있습니다.\n\nexpectSaga의 프로바이더는 정적 프로바이더와 동적 프로바이더, 2가지로 나뉩니다.\n정적 프로바이더는 쉽게 조합과 재사용이 되고, 동적 프로바이더는 비결정적인 이펙트들로 유연함을 줍니다.\n다음 예제는 정적 프로바이더를 사용하였습니다. 프로바이더의 더 많은 예제는 \n여기\n에 있습니다.\n\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport { throwError } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* userSaga() {\n  try {\n    const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n    const pet = yield call(api.fetchPet, user.petId);\n\n    yield put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user, pet },\n    });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches the user', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { name: 'Jeremy', petId: 20 };\n  const fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [call(api.fetchUser, 42), fakeUser],\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchPet), fakeDog],\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user: fakeUser, pet: fakeDog },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('handles errors', () => {\n  const error = new Error('error');\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), throwError(error)],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nmatcher와 가짜 값을 포함하는 튜플의 쌍(혹은 배열의 쌍)의 배열을 전달하는 것을 확인하세요. Redux Saga의\n이팩트 생성자 혹은 이팩트에 대응하는 redux-saga-test-plan/matchers 모듈의 매처를 사용할\n수 있습니다. Redux Saga Test Plan의 매처를 사용하면 call.fn 같은 매처의 경우 이 함수와\n대응되는 실제 call 이팩트가 포함하는 특정 args 에 대헤 신경쓰지 않고 사용할 수 있습니다. 두번째\n테스트는 redux-saga-test-plan/providers 모듈의 throwError 함수로 에러들을 시뮬레이트합니다. \n이것은 서버 문제를

You can handle these situations with\npartial matchers.\nThe following assertions have a like method along with convenient helper\nmethods for partially matching assertions:\n\nactionChannel\napply\ncall\ncps\nfork\nput\nput.resolve\nselect\nspawn\n\nNOTE: the like method requires knowledge of the properties on effects such\nas the fn property of call and the action property of put. Essentially,\nlike allows you to match effects with certain properties without worrying\nabout the other properties. Therefore, you can match a call by fn without\nworrying about the args property.\nIn addition to like, there are other some common helper methods like fn and\nactionType available, appropriate to the kind of effect:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactionChannel.pattern\nMatch actionChannel by pattern. Useful if you use custom buffers with actionChannel.\n\n\napply.fn\nMatch apply by fn.\n\n\ncall.fn\nMatch call by fn.\n\n\ncps.fn\nMatch cps by fn.\n\n\nfork.fn\nMatch fork by fn.\n\n\nput.actionType\nMatch put by action.type.\n\n\nput.resolve.actionType\nMatch put.resolve by action.type.\n\n\nselect.selector\nMatch select by selector function.\n\n\nspawn.fn\nMatch spawn by fn.\n\n\n\nOrdering\nProviders are checked from left to right (or top to down depending on how you\nlook at it). The first provider to match an effect is used, skipping subsequent\nproviders. If no providers match, then the effect is handled by Redux Saga as\nnormal.\nimport { call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\nimport * as selectors from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.findUser, 1);\n  const dog = yield call(api.findDog);\n  const greeting = yield call(api.findGreeting);\n  const otherData = yield select(selectors.getOtherData);\n\n  yield put({\n    type: 'DONE',\n    payload: { user, dog, greeting, otherData },\n  });\n}\n\nconst fakeUser = { name: 'John Doe' };\nconst fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\nconst fakeOtherData = { foo: 'bar' };\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.findUser), fakeUser],\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.findDog), fakeDog],\n      [select(selectors.getOtherData), fakeOtherData],\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nThrow Errors\nYou can simulate errors with static providers via the throwError function from\nthe redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. When providing an error, wrap it\nwith a call to throwError to let Redux Saga Test Plan know that you want to\nsimulate a thrown error.\nimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport { throwError } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('handles errors', () => {\n  const error = new Error('error');\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), throwError(error)],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error })\n    .run();\n});\n\nStatic Providers with Dynamic Values\nStatic providers can provide dynamic values too. Instead of supplying a static\nvalue, you can supply a function that produces the value. This function takes as\narguments the matched effect as well as a next function. Additionally, you\nmust wrap the function with a call to the dynamic function from the\nredux-saga-test-plan/providers module.

The easiest\nway is to pass in an array of object providers to the provide method. Provider\nfunctions will be composed according to the effect type, meaning the provider\nfunctions in the first object will be called before subsequent provider\nfunctions in the array.\nBecause provider functions are composed, they are similar to middleware. The\nnext function argument inside provider functions allows you to delegate to the\nnext provider in the middleware stack. If no more providers are available, then\nnext will delegate to Redux Saga to handle the effect as normal.\nimport { call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport api from 'my-api';\nimport * as selectors from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.findUser, 1);\n  const dog = yield call(api.findDog);\n  const greeting = yield call(api.findGreeting);\n  const otherData = yield select(selectors.getOtherData);\n\n  yield put({\n    type: 'DONE',\n    payload: { user, dog, greeting, otherData },\n  });\n}\n\nconst fakeUser = { name: 'John Doe' };\nconst fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\nconst fakeOtherData = { foo: 'bar' };\n\nconst provideUser = ({ fn, args: [id] }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findUser ? fakeUser : next()\n);\n\nconst provideDog = ({ fn }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findDog ? fakeDog : next()\n);\n\nconst provideOtherData = ({ selector }, next) => (\n  selector === selectors.getOtherData ? fakeOtherData : next()\n);\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      { call: provideUser, select: provideOtherData },\n      { call: provideDog },\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nAn alternative to supplying multiple provider objects is to only pass one object\ninto provide and use the composeProviders function to compose multiple\nprovider functions for a specific effect. You can import the composeProviders\nfunction from the redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. The provider\nfunctions are composed from left to right.\nimport { composeProviders } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call: composeProviders(\n        provideUser,\n        provideDog\n      ),\n\n      select: provideOtherData,\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMore Examples\nFor some more contrived examples of providers, look in the\nrepo tests.\nCaveats\nFor providers to work, expectSaga will necessarily wrap forked/spawned sagas\nwith an intermediary generator called sagaWrapper in order to intercept\neffects.

Instead you're only\nconcerned with if a particular function was invoked via call or if a\nparticular action type was dispatched via put. You can handle these situations\nwith partial matcher assertions.\nThe following assertions have a like method along with convenient helper\nmethods for partially matching assertions:\n\nactionChannel\napply\ncall\ncps\nfork\nput\nput.resolve\nselect\nspawn\n\nNOTE: the like method requires knowledge of the properties on effects such\nas the fn property of call and the action property of put. Essentially,\nlike allows you to match effects with certain properties without worrying\nabout the other properties. Therefore, you can match a call by fn without\nworrying about the args property.\nExample\nHere is a simple example using like:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.like({ fn: api.fetchUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.like({ action: { type: 'FAIL_USER' } })\n    .run();\n});\n\nNotice that we can assert that the api.fetchUser function was called without\nspecifying the arguments.

Here's an example to show what wouldn't work with save and\nrestore.\nfunction getPredicate() {}\nfunction itWasTrue() {}\nfunction itWasFalse() {}\n\nexport default function* mainSaga() {\n  try {\n    yield take('READY');\n\n    const predicate = yield select(getPredicate);\n\n    if (predicate) {\n      yield take('TRUE');\n      yield call(itWasTrue);\n    } else {\n      yield take('FALSE');\n      yield call(itWasFalse);\n    }\n\n    yield put({ type: 'DONE', payload: predicate });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield take('ERROR');\n  }\n}\n\nconst saga = testSaga(mainSaga);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .take('READY')\n\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .save('before predicate') // \nEven though we restore the 'before predicate' label and supply a new value to\nthe predicate variable, that will get overwritten to whatever the history for\npredicate was when we saved the 'before final put' label. True time travel\nis not available yet but is a tentatively planned feature in the future. Ideas\nand contributions are welcome to add true time travel.\n"}}}
