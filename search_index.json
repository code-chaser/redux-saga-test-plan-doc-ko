Saga Test Plan\n\n\n\nTest Redux Saga with an easy plan.\nRedux Saga Test Plan makes testing sagas a breeze. Whether you need to test\nexact effects and their ordering or just test your saga put's a specific\naction at some point, Redux Saga Test Plan has you covered.\nRedux Saga Test Plan aims to embrace both unit testing and integration testing\napproaches to make testing your sagas easy.\nIntegration Testing\nRequires global Promise to be available\nOne downside to unit testing sagas is that it couples your test to your\nimplementation. Simple reordering of yielded effects in your saga could break\nyour tests even if the functionality stays the same. If you're not concerned\nwith the order or exact effects your saga yields, then you can take a\nintegrative approach, testing the behavior of your saga when run by Redux Saga.\nThen, you can simply test that a particular effect was yielded during the saga\nrun. For this, use the expectSaga test function.\nSimple Example\nImport the expectSaga function and pass in your saga function as an argument.\nAny additional arguments to expectSaga will become arguments to the saga\nfunction. The return value is a chainable API with assertions for the different\neffect creators available in Redux Saga.\nIn the example below, we test that the userSaga successfully puts a\nRECEIVE_USER action with the fakeUser as the payload. We call expectSaga\nwith the userSaga and supply an api object as an argument to userSaga. We\nassert the expected put effect via the put assertion method. Then, we call\nthe dispatch method with a REQUEST_USER action that contains the user id\npayload. The dispatch method will supply actions to take effects. Finally,\nwe start the test by calling the run method which returns a Promise. Tests\nwith expectSaga will always run asynchronously, so the returned Promise\nresolves when the saga finishes or when expectSaga forces a timeout. If you're\nusing a test runner like Jest, you can return the Promise inside your Jest\ntest so Jest knows when the test is complete.\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction* userSaga(api) {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('just works!', () => {\n  const api = {\n    fetchUser: id => ({ id, name: 'Tucker' }),\n  };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    // Assert that the `put` will eventually happen.\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 42, name: 'Tucker' },\n    })\n\n    // Dispatch any actions that the saga will `take`.\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n\n    // Start the test. Returns a Promise.\n    .run();\n});\n\nMocking with Providers\nexpectSaga runs your saga with Redux Saga, so it will try to resolve effects\njust like Redux Saga would in your application. This is great for integration\ntesting, but sometimes it can be laborious to bootstrap your entire application\nfor tests or mock things like server APIs. In those cases, you can use\nproviders which are perfect for mocking values directly with expectSaga.\nProviders are similar to middleware that allow you to intercept effects before\nthey reach Redux Saga. You can choose to return a mock value instead of allowing\nRedux Saga to handle the effect, or you can pass on the effect to other\nproviders or eventually Redux Saga.\nexpectSaga has two flavors of providers, static providers and dynamic\nproviders. Static providers are easier to compose and reuse, but dynamic\nproviders give you more flexibility with non-deterministic effects. Here is one\nexample below using static providers. There are more examples of providers in\nthe\ndocs.\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport * as matchers from 'redux-saga-test-plan/matchers';\nimport { throwError } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* userSaga() {\n  try {\n    const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.payload);\n    const pet = yield call(api.fetchPet, user.petId);\n\n    yield put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user, pet },\n    });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches the user', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { name: 'Jeremy', petId: 20 };\n  const fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [call(api.fetchUser, 42), fakeUser],\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchPet), fakeDog],\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { user: fakeUser, pet: fakeDog },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('handles errors', () => {\n  const error = new Error('error');\n\n  return expectSaga(userSaga, api)\n    .provide([\n      [matchers.call.fn(api.fetchUser), throwError(error)],\n    ])\n    .put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 42 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nNotice we pass in an array of tuple pairs (or array pairs) that contain a\nmatcher and a fake value. You can use the effect creators from Redux Saga or\nmatchers from the redux-saga-test-plan/matchers module to match effects. The\nbonus of using Redux Saga Test Plan's matchers is that they offer special\npartial matchers like call.fn which matches by the function without worrying\nabout the specific args contained in the actual call effect. Notice in the\nsecond test that we can also simulate errors with the throwError function from\nthe redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. This is perfect for simulating\nserver problems.\nExample with Reducer\nOne good use case for integration testing is testing your reducer too. You can\nhook up your reducer to your test by calling the withReducer method with your\nreducer function.\nimport { call, select, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nconst HAVE_BIRTHDAY = 'HAVE_BIRTHDAY';\nconst UPDATE_DOG = 'UPDATE_DOG';\n\nconst initialState = {\n  dog: {\n    name: 'Tucker',\n    age: 11,\n  },\n};\n\nfunction reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  if (action.type === HAVE_BIRTHDAY) {\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      dog: {\n        ...state.dog,\n        age: state.dog.age + 1,\n      },\n    };\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nconst getDog = state => state.dog;\n\nfunction* saga(api) {\n  yield take(UPDATE_DOG);\n  const dog = yield select(getDog);\n  yield call(api.updateDog, dog);\n}\n\nit('handles reducers', () => {\n  const api = { updateDog() {} };\n\n  return expectSaga(saga, api)\n    .withReducer(reducer)\n\n    .call(api.updateDog, {\n      name: 'Tucker',\n      age: 12,\n    })\n\n    .dispatch({ type: HAVE_BIRTHDAY })\n    .dispatch({ type: UPDATE_DOG })\n\n    .run();\n});\n\nUnit Testing\nIf you want to ensure that your saga yields specific types of effects in a\nparticular order, then you'll want to use the testSaga function. Here's a\nsimple example:\nimport { testSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x, y) {\n  const action = yield take('HELLO');\n\n  yield put({ type: 'ADD', payload: x + y });\n  yield call(identity, action);\n}\n\nconst action = { type: 'TEST' };\n\nit('works with unit tests', () => {\n  testSaga(mainSaga, 40, 2);\n    // advance saga with `next()`\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `take` with `'HELLO'` as type\n    .take('HELLO')\n\n    // pass back in a value to a saga after it yields\n    .next(action)\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `put` with the expected action\n    .put({ type: 'ADD', payload: 42 })\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields a `call` to `identity` with\n    // the `action` argument\n    .call(identity, action)\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga is finished\n    .isDone();\n});\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nGetting Started\nIntegration Testing\nEffect Creator Assertions\nDispatching\nTimeout\nState\nMocking\nStatic Providers\nDynamic Providers\n\n\nPartial Assertions\nNegated Assertions\nExposed Effects\nSnapshot Testing\nReturn Value\nForked Sagas\n\n\nUnit Testing\nError Messages\nEffect Creators\nSaga Helpers\nGeneral Assertions\nTime Travel\n\n\n\n"},"docs/getting-started.html":{"url":"docs/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nInstall\nRedux Saga 1.0 Beta\nRedux Saga Test Plan v4.0.0-beta.1 supports Redux Saga v1.0.0-beta.1.\nInstall with yarn or npm.\nyarn add redux-saga-test-plan@beta --dev\nnpm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan@beta\nRedux Saga Stable\nRedux Saga Test Plan v3 supports Redux Saga >= v0.15.\nInstall with yarn or npm.\nyarn add redux-saga-test-plan --dev\nnpm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan\n"},"docs/integration-testing/":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/","title":"Integration Testing","keywords":"","body":"통합 테스트\nPromise가 사용 가능 해야합니다.\nRedux Saga Test Plan은 통합 테스트를 하기 위해 saga effect들이 반환하는 값을 검증을 위한 API를\n반환하는 expectSaga함수를 제공합니다. expectSaga를 사용하기 위해서는 첫 번째 인자에 generator 함수를\n넣습니다. 그 generator 함수에 사용될 인자의 값들을 추가적인 인자로 넣습니다.\nexpectSaga runs your saga with Redux Saga's runSaga function, so it will run\njust like it would in your application.

Returning a call to the next function will tell Redux Saga\nTest Plan to try the next provider, similar to a middleware stack.

To ensure that your saga receives back a task object with a correct\nmeta.name property, Redux Saga Test Plan will attempt to rename the sagaWrapper\nfunction to the name of a forked saga. This works in almost all JavaScript\nenvironments but will fail in PhantomJS. Therefore, you can't depend on the\ntask meta.name property being correct in PhantomJS.\n"},"docs/integration-testing/mocking/dynamic-providers.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/mocking/dynamic-providers.html","title":"Dynamic Providers","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic Providers\nYou can use completely dynamic providers by passing in an object literal to the\nprovide method.

If you don't want\nto handle the effect yourself, you can pass it on to Redux Saga by invoking the\nnext callback parameter.\nHere is an example with Jest to show you how to supply a fake value for an API\ncall:\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the API call', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        // Check for the API call to return fake value\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          const id = effect.args[0];\n          return { id, name: 'John Doe' };\n        }\n\n        // Allow Redux Saga to handle other `call` effects\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nEffect Creators\nEven though you'll probably never need them all, you can supply a provider for\nalmost every effect creator:\n\nall\nactionChannel\ncall *\ncancel\ncancelled\ncps\nflush\nfork\ngetContext\njoin\nput **\nrace\nselect\nsetContext\nspawn\ntake **\n\n*Because there is no way to distinguish the apply and call effects, you\nmust handle apply effects with the call provider function.\n**To handle takeMaybe and putResolve, use the take and put providers,\nrespectively. You can inspect take effects for the maybe property and put\neffects for the resolve property.\nOther Examples\nSelect\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const name = yield select(selectors.getName);\n  const age = yield select(selectors.getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the selector', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nParallel Effects via all\nProviders work on effects yielded inside an all effect.\nimport { all, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield all([\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ]);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides values for effects inside arrays', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nOr you can provide a value for the entire array of effects via the all\nprovider:\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield all([\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ]);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the entire array', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      all: () => ['Tucker', 11],\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nRace\nimport { call, put, race, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nconst delay = time => (\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time))\n);\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const { user } = yield race({\n    user: call(api.fetchUser, id),\n    timeout: call(delay, 500),\n  });\n\n  if (user) {\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } else {\n    yield put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' });\n  }\n}\n\ntest('fetching the user succeeds', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' };\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ user: fakeUser }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\ntest('timeout wins', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ timeout: undefined }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\nErrors\nYou can simulate errors by throwing from a provider:\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('can throw errors in the saga', () => {\n  const error = new Error('Whoops...');\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          throw error;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ error, type: 'FAIL_USER' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nProviding in Forked/Spawned Sagas\nProviders work for effects in forked/spawned sagas too.\nimport { call, fork, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* fetchUserSaga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser);\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nfunction* forkingSaga() {\n  yield fork(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nfunction* spawningSaga() {\n  yield spawn(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nit('provides values in forked sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(forkingSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('provides values in spawned sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(spawningSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Providers\nYou can supply multiple object providers via a couple of methods. The easiest\nway is to pass in an array of object providers to the provide method. Provider\nfunctions will be composed according to the effect type, meaning the provider\nfunctions in the first object will be called before subsequent provider\nfunctions in the array.\nBecause provider functions are composed, they are similar to middleware. The\nnext function argument inside provider functions allows you to delegate to the\nnext provider in the middleware stack. If no more providers are available, then\nnext will delegate to Redux Saga to handle the effect as normal.\nimport { call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport api from 'my-api';\nimport * as selectors from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.findUser, 1);\n  const dog = yield call(api.findDog);\n  const greeting = yield call(api.findGreeting);\n  const otherData = yield select(selectors.getOtherData);\n\n  yield put({\n    type: 'DONE',\n    payload: { user, dog, greeting, otherData },\n  });\n}\n\nconst fakeUser = { name: 'John Doe' };\nconst fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\nconst fakeOtherData = { foo: 'bar' };\n\nconst provideUser = ({ fn, args: [id] }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findUser ? fakeUser : next()\n);\n\nconst provideDog = ({ fn }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findDog ? fakeDog : next()\n);\n\nconst provideOtherData = ({ selector }, next) => (\n  selector === selectors.getOtherData ? fakeOtherData : next()\n);\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      { call: provideUser, select: provideOtherData },\n      { call: provideDog },\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nAn alternative to supplying multiple provider objects is to only pass one object\ninto provide and use the composeProviders function to compose multiple\nprovider functions for a specific effect. You can import the composeProviders\nfunction from the redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. The provider\nfunctions are composed from left to right.\nimport { composeProviders } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call: composeProviders(\n        provideUser,\n        provideDog\n      ),\n\n      select: provideOtherData,\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMore Examples\nFor some more contrived examples of providers, look in the\nrepo tests.\nCaveats\nFor providers to work, expectSaga will necessarily wrap forked/spawned sagas\nwith an intermediary generator called sagaWrapper in order to intercept\neffects. To ensure that your saga receives back a task object with a correct\nmeta.name property, Redux Saga Test Plan will attempt to rename the sagaWrapper\nfunction to the name of a forked saga. This works in almost all JavaScript\nenvironments but will fail in PhantomJS. Therefore, you can't depend on the\ntask meta.name property being correct in PhantomJS.\n"},"docs/integration-testing/partial-matching.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/partial-matching.html","title":"Partial Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Partial Matching Assertions\nSometimes you're not interested in the exact arguments passed to a call effect\ncreator or the payload inside an action from a put effect. Instead you're only\nconcerned with if a particular function was invoked via call or if a\nparticular action type was dispatched via put. You can handle these situations\nwith partial matcher assertions.\nThe following assertions have a like method along with convenient helper\nmethods for partially matching assertions:\n\nactionChannel\napply\ncall\ncps\nfork\nput\nput.resolve\nselect\nspawn\n\nNOTE: the like method requires knowledge of the properties on effects such\nas the fn property of call and the action property of put. Essentially,\nlike allows you to match effects with certain properties without worrying\nabout the other properties. Therefore, you can match a call by fn without\nworrying about the args property.\nExample\nHere is a simple example using like:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.like({ fn: api.fetchUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.like({ action: { type: 'FAIL_USER' } })\n    .run();\n});\n\nNotice that we can assert that the api.fetchUser function was called without\nspecifying the arguments. We can also assert in a failure scenario that an\naction of type FAIL_USER was dispatched without worrying about the error\nproperty of the action.\nHelper Methods Example\nWe can simplify the previous example with the convenient matcher helper methods\ncall.fn and put.actionType:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.fn(api.fetchUser)\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.actionType('FAIL_USER')\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Properties\nIf you need it in rare cases, you can match on multiple shallow or deep\nproperties via like:\nfunction* saga(id) {\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 42,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n\n  // This will be matched\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 43,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n}\n\nit('can match on multiple properties', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .put.like({\n      action: {\n        type: 'FOO',\n        payload: 43,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nHelper Methods\nThere are other some common helper methods like fn and actionType available,\nappropriate to the kind of effect:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactionChannel.pattern\nMatch actionChannel by pattern. Useful if you use custom buffers with actionChannel.\n\n\napply.fn\nMatch apply by fn.\n\n\ncall.fn\nMatch call by fn.\n\n\ncps.fn\nMatch cps by fn.\n\n\nfork.fn\nMatch fork by fn.\n\n\nput.actionType\nMatch put by action.type.\n\n\nput.resolve.actionType\nMatch put.resolve by action.type.\n\n\nselect.selector\nMatch select by selector function.\n\n\nspawn.fn\nMatch spawn by fn.\n\n\n\n"},"docs/integration-testing/negated-assertions.html":{"url":"docs/integration-testing/negated-assertions.html","title":"Negated Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Negated Assertions\nYou can negate assertions too.
